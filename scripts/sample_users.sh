# Rev: 1.1 Removed L-Pass profiles from the wanted list so they end
#          up on the undesireable list, and will not end up in the 
#          duplicate user database. If they don't show up there
#          they won't fail the duplicate user test, and be able 
#          to successfully register for an EPL card. This is desireable
#          because students at the UofA can get an EPL card if they
#          live within the Edmonton tax catchment, and it became a
#          problem during the COVID-19 crisis April 21, 2020.
